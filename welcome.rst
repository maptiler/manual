MapTiler Enigne is a software for map tile rendering. It transforms supplied raster geodata from existing coordinate system (SRS - Spatial Reference System) into map tiles suitable for Google Maps API mashups, native mobile applications with Apple MapKit, open-source RouteMe library for iOS or OSMDroid for Google Android platform. Supported is a direct export to Google Earth products as well. The produced tiles can be used for online publishing according to the OpenGIS WMTS standard as well.

The produced map tiles can be easily served from existing in-house web servers, from practically any standard web-hosting provider, and from a public or private cloud. Hosting of maps is also possible from an external content distribution network (such as the Akamai's CDN with over 100.000 servers in 78 countries) to serve the geodata with higher speed and reliability by automatically caching it geographically closer to your online visitors.

MapTiler Engine can be used for processing a large quantity of input files with high-resolution. The tool has been designed for producing seamless maps and aerial photo layers covering whole countries. The rendering is fast and efficient, and it can fully utilize multiple CPUs to 100%. It is heavily optimized and directly working with the raw input data and computer memory mapping for producing the map tiles - without any intermediate steps and layers (such as HTTP requests / transcoding of the rasters / etc).

This and other internal tricks makes this tool a magnitude faster than any other existing solution.

Thank you for choosing MapTiler Engine.
